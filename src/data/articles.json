There are people in general regardless of gender who profit off their looks. Whether that is as simple as a first impression in an interview or as complicated as a marriage founded on appearance. This is not a judgment piece; more of a realization from having had the luxury of being on both sides of the transaction. Nobody should dictate how you live your life but when you're a hoe it's important that the same reason you profit will be the same reason you lose.",
