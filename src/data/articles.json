    "body": "It's unfortunate that in our male dominated society, the only opportunity some women have is to sell their looks or body. I don't mean just prostitution, but more of the subtle type. There are more to hoes than booty shaking mamas. There are people in general regardless of gender who profit off their looks. Whether that is as simple as a first impression in an interview or as complicated as a marriage founded on appearance. This is not a judgment piece; more of a realization from having had the luxury of being on both sides of the transaction. Be self-sufficient and don't let anybody dictate your life entirely. It's pretty obvious, but if you realize that you are a hoe who has pinned his whole identity on appearance, don't be surprised for that day when you sag and wither and everyone who showed up before because you were pretty, don't treat you the same.",
